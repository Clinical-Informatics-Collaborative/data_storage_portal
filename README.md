# data_storage_portal
A repository to store data files generated by the [R package {generatervis}](https://github.com/Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/generatervis). This repository is inspired by [cBioportal/datahub](https://github.com/cBioPortal/datahub/tree/master/public) and is being used only for learning purposes. It will be used to test, refine, and improve the output from the [R package {generatervis}](https://github.com/Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/generatervis).


Anyone who wants to try uploading data to this learning repository should generate all the files from my [R package {generatervis}](https://github.com/Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/generatervis) and be able to upload them to this repository.
